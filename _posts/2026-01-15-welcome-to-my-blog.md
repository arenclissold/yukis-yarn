Hello and welcome! This is my first post on Yuki's Yarn.

## How This Blog Works

Adding a new post is simple:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`
3. Add the frontmatter at the top (title, date, layout)
4. Write your content in markdown

That's it! Jekyll will automatically pick it up and add it to the homepage.

## What I'll Write About

I'm excited to share my thoughts on various topics. Stay tuned for more posts coming soon.
