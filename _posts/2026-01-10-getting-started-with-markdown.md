Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing for the web easy and enjoyable. Here's a quick guide to the basics.

## Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or _italic_ easily. You can also use `inline code` for technical terms.

## Lists

Unordered lists:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

## Links and Images

Create links like this: [Visit Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)

## Code Blocks

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting quotes or important information.

Happy writing!
